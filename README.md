## ðŸ‘¥ How to get a Facebook permanent access token

Following the instructions laid out in Facebook's [extending page tokens documentation][2] I was able to get a page access token that does not expire.

I suggest using the [Graph API Explorer][3] for all of these steps except where otherwise stated.

### 0. Create Facebook App ###

**If you already have an app**, skip to step 1.

1. Go to [My Apps][4].
2. Click "+ Add a New App".
3. Setup a website app.

You don't need to change its permissions or anything. You just need an app that wont go away before you're done with your access token.

### 1. Get User Short-Lived Access Token ###

1. Go to the [Graph API Explorer][3].
2. Select the application you want to get the access token for (in the "Facebook App" drop-down menu, not the "My Apps" menu).
3. Click "Get Token" > "Get User Access Token".
4. In the "Add a Permission" drop-down, search and check "manage_pages", "publish_pages" and "pages_show_list".
5. Click "Generate Access Token".
6. Grant access from a Facebook account that has access to manage the target page. Note that if this user loses access the final, never-expiring access token will likely stop working.

The token that appears in the "Access Token" field is your short-lived access token.

### 2. Generate Long-Lived Access Token ###

Following [these instructions][5] from the Facebook docs, make a GET request to

> https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token?grant_type=fb_exchange_token&client_id=**{app_id}**&client_secret=**{app_secret}**&fb_exchange_token=**{short_lived_token}**

entering in your app's ID and secret and the short-lived token generated in the previous step.

You **cannot use the Graph API Explorer**. For some reason it gets stuck on this request. I think it's because the response isn't JSON, but a query string. Since it's a GET request, you can just go to the URL in your browser.

The response should look like this:

> {"access_token":"**ABC123**","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":5183791}

"ABC123" will be your long-lived access token. You can put it into the [Access Token Debugger][7] to verify. Under "Expires" it should have something like "2 months".

### 3. Get User ID ###

Using the long-lived access token, make a GET request to 

> https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=**{long_lived_access_token}**

The `id` field is your account ID. You'll need it for the next step.

### 4. Get Permanent Page Access Token ###

Make a GET request to

> https://graph.facebook.com/**{account_id}**/accounts?access_token=**{long_lived_access_token}**

The JSON response should have a `data` field under which is an array of items the user has access to. Find the item for the page you want the permanent access token from. The `access_token` field should have your permanent access token. Copy it and test it in the [Access Token Debugger][7]. Under "Expires" it should say "Never".
